            <h3>
                What are Number Systems?
            </h3>
            <p><br>The number system or the numeral system is the system of naming or representing numbers. 
                We know that a number is a mathematical value that helps to count or measure objects and it helps in performing various mathematical calculations.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Types of Number System :
            </h3>
            <p>
                <br>There are various types of number systems in mathematics. The four most common number system types are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Decimal number system (Base- 10)</li>
                        <li>Binary number system (Base- 2)</li>
                            <li>Octal number system (Base-8)</li>
                                <li> Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16)</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Decimal Number System :
            </h3>
            <p>
                <br>The decimal number system has a base of 10 because it uses ten digits from 0 to 9. In the decimal number system, the positions successive to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. This system is expressed in decimal numbers. 
                Every position shows a particular power of the base (10).
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Binary Number System :
            </h3>
            <p>
                <br>The base 2 number system is also known as the Binary number system wherein, only two binary digits exist, i.e., 0 and 1. Specifically, the usual base-2 is a radix of 2. The figures described under this system are known as binary numbers which are the combination of 0 and 1. For example, 110101 is a binary number.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Octal Number System :
            </h3>
            <p>
                <br>In the octal number system, the base is 8 and it uses numbers from 0 to 7 to represent numbers. Octal numbers are commonly used in computer applications.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Hexa-Decimal Number System :
            </h3>
            <p>
                <br>In the hexadecimal system, numbers are written or represented with base 16. In the hex system, the numbers are first represented just like in the decimal system, i.e. from 0 to 9. Then, the numbers are represented using the alphabet from A to F.
                <br><br>

        </div>
            <p>                
                <br>Numbers can be represented in any of the number system categories like binary, decimal, hex, etc. Also, any number which is represented in any of the number system types can be easily converted to other. Check the detailed lesson on the conversions of number systems to learn how to convert numbers in decimal to binary and vice versa, hexadecimal to binary and vice versa, and octal to binary and vice versa using various examples.
                <br>
                With the help of the different conversion procedures explained above, now let us discuss in brief about the conversion of one number system to the other number system by taking a random number.
                <br>
                <br>
                The number 349 in different number systems is as follows :
                <br><br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>The number 349 in the binary number system is 101011101</li>
                <br>
                    <li>The number 349 in the decimal number system is 349.</li>
                <br>
                    <li>The number 349 in the octal number system is 535.</li>
                <br>
                    <li>The number 349 in the hexadecimal number system is 15D</li>
